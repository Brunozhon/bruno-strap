# What source is used for the translations from English to Chinese?

I used [Google translate](https://translate.google.com/). You can translate

- ["Thank you" to chinese](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=zh-CN&text=thank%20you)
- ["doing" to chinese](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=zh-CN&text=doing)
- And much more!
